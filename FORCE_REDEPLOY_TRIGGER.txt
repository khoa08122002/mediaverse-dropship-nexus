FORCE REDEPLOY - TailwindCSS Dependencies Fix
===========================================

Timestamp: 2025-01-06 (Updated)
Reason: Fixed duplicate TailwindCSS and PostCSS dependencies causing white page

Changes Applied:
✅ Removed duplicate tailwindcss from devDependencies  
✅ Removed duplicate postcss from devDependencies
✅ All CSS build dependencies now only in production dependencies
✅ Emergency deploy script updated with fallback

Expected Result:
- PostCSS should successfully load tailwindcss plugin
- CSS compilation should work correctly  
- No more white page on deployment
- Full TailwindCSS styling should be available

Build Command: npm run vercel-build (emergency-deploy.js)
Dependencies: tailwindcss, autoprefixer, postcss (all in dependencies)

This trigger will force Vercel to:
1. Clear dependency cache
2. Fresh install all dependencies  
3. Rebuild with correct CSS processing
4. Deploy with proper styling

Previous Issue:
"Cannot find module 'tailwindcss'" in postcss.config.cjs

Resolution:
Eliminated dependency conflicts by ensuring CSS build tools 
are available in production environment.
