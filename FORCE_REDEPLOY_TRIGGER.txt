ðŸš€ FORCE DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER - TailwindCSS & MIME Type Fixes Applied

Timestamp: 2024-01-07 23:XX:XX
Trigger ID: TAILWIND-MIME-FIX-v2

Changes Applied:
âœ… TailwindCSS moved to production dependencies  
âœ… PostCSS and Autoprefixer in production dependencies
âœ… @vitejs/plugin-react in production dependencies
âœ… Enhanced Vercel routing for proper asset serving
âœ… Emergency deployment with TailwindCSS fallbacks
âœ… MIME type error fixes for SPA routing

Expected Results After Deployment:
- No more white page issues
- Proper TailwindCSS styling loaded
- No MIME type errors for /src/main.tsx
- Assets served correctly from /assets/ folder
- SPA routing working without affecting static assets

If deployment still shows issues:
1. Check that dependencies were properly installed
2. Verify Vercel picked up the new package.json
3. Use emergency deployment: npm run deploy:emergency
4. Check build logs for any remaining PostCSS errors
