FORCE REDEPLOY - Data Conflicts COMPLETELY FIXED
===============================================

Timestamp: 2025-01-06 (Final Fix)
Reason: Fixed ALL hardcoded URLs causing data conflicts

COMPLETE DATA CONFLICT RESOLUTION:
âœ… Fixed userService.ts - removed hardcoded https://phg2.vercel.app/api/comprehensive
âœ… Fixed environment.ts - use current domain /api/backend instead of old URL
âœ… Fixed AuthContext.tsx - removed hardcoded URLs  
âœ… Fixed recruitmentService.ts - removed hardcoded URLs
âœ… Fixed lib/axios.ts - use current domain /api/backend
âœ… Fixed config/axios.ts - use current domain /api/backend
âœ… Added cache validation system to prevent conflicts

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:
- Frontend was calling 2 different APIs:
  1. https://phg2.vercel.app/api/comprehensive (MOCK DATA with John Doe, Jane Smith, etc.)
  2. current-domain/api/backend (REAL DATABASE)
- This caused reload to show different data sources randomly
- Write operations sometimes went to wrong endpoint

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
ðŸŽ¯ ALL services now use: ${window.location.origin}/api/backend
ðŸŽ¯ Real database endpoint for ALL operations
ðŸŽ¯ Cache validation on app startup
ðŸŽ¯ No more hardcoded URLs anywhere

VERCEL ROUTING:
- /api/backend/* â†’ api/backend.js (REAL DATABASE - âœ… NOW USED)  
- /api/comprehensive/* â†’ api/comprehensive.js (mock data - now unused)

EXPECTED RESULTS:
âœ… Single consistent data source (real database)
âœ… Create/edit operations persist after reload
âœ… No more mixed mock/real data
âœ… Supabase database receives all writes
âœ… Data consistency across all pages

This deployment will COMPLETELY RESOLVE the data conflicts issue!

Timestamp: 2025-01-06 (Updated)
Reason: Fixed duplicate TailwindCSS and PostCSS dependencies causing white page

Changes Applied:
âœ… Removed duplicate tailwindcss from devDependencies  
âœ… Removed duplicate postcss from devDependencies
âœ… All CSS build dependencies now only in production dependencies
âœ… Emergency deploy script updated with fallback

Expected Result:
- PostCSS should successfully load tailwindcss plugin
- CSS compilation should work correctly  
- No more white page on deployment
- Full TailwindCSS styling should be available

Build Command: npm run vercel-build (emergency-deploy.js)
Dependencies: tailwindcss, autoprefixer, postcss (all in dependencies)

This trigger will force Vercel to:
1. Clear dependency cache
2. Fresh install all dependencies  
3. Rebuild with correct CSS processing
4. Deploy with proper styling

Previous Issue:
"Cannot find module 'tailwindcss'" in postcss.config.cjs

Resolution:
Eliminated dependency conflicts by ensuring CSS build tools 
are available in production environment.
